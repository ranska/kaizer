# kaizer
kaizer is test integration targeted first for html5 video game 

# It use Aspect oriented programation
see [you are da chef](https://github.com/raganwald/YouAreDaChef)

# It was extract (wip) from a real game
because my game logic was realy complex and strongly coupling to the render process,
create an integration test set was the only way to continue developping without became totaly mad :)

# Tested with phaserJS
Screen cast is coming

# Is Ã  good way for real video game test integration
because nowdays testing game is hard

# can be used by game designer to adjust some game part
because rerun specific part of game with changing and equilibrate value
is a big part of game desinger job.
